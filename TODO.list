swimmers in lammps:

Andersen thermostat - inside reset_velocities -
   just redraw velocities from M-B
   (we will have to do AT+a later on)
   bigbin helps retrieve the identity of the big particle in a searchbin
   In reset_velocities, when looping over the bins, check to see if there is a 
   big particle in the cell (ibin, binbig).  Get the number of SRD cells in the 
   cell, assign virtual particles, etc etc.!


Swimmers - riff off 'noslip'.  Place the new positions like before, except add 
    the surface velocities (instead of the tangent crap).



calculate bin overlap
